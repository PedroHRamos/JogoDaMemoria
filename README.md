# JogoDaMemoria
A simple Memory Game to practice and learn more about Angular, Typescript, meet new libraries. I pretend make this project one of my portfolio of projects.
I choose Angular Because I have to turn better my knowledge about front-end. Also I think that Angular turn the html cleaner and turn possible to use the components in a bigger project like a portfolio.
